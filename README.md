Pairman's Linux From Scratch Distribution 11.3 x86_64 20230529 version, supporting only Surface Pro 7+.

Added many packages and features in addition to the LFS and BLFS book, mainly: UEFI support, microcode for CPU, GPU and WLAN support, modifications for bash profile and init script, ```mimalloc``` as the default malloc() library.

This OS is intended to be used only for educational purposes. Files' copyright belongs to their original owners.

The split files are generated by ```split -b 25M input.tar.xz output.tar.xz.part```, and you can retrieve it using ```cat input.tar.bz2.part* > output.tar.gz```, though not recommended. You at least need to 1) modify ```/boot/grub/grub.cfg```, 2) regenerate the EFI files according to the BLFS book, 3) recofigure and recompile the kernel with customized drivers/microcodes and 4) reconfigured scripts in ```/etc/init.d```, ```/etc/udev``` and ```/etc/sysconfig``` to make it bootable.
