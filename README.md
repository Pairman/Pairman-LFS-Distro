The split files are generated by ```split -b 25M input.tar.xz output.tar.xz.part```, and you can retrieve it using ```cat input.tar.bz2.part* > output.tar.gz```, though not recommended. You at least need to modify ```/boot/grub/grub.cfg``` and regenerate the EFI files according to the BLFS book to make it bootable.
