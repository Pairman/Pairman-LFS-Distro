The split files are generated by ```split -b 25M input.tar.xz output.tar.xz.part```, and you can retrieve it using ```cat input.tar.bz2.part* > output.tar.gz```. You need at least 1) modify ```/boot/grub/grub.cfg``` and regenerate the EFI files under ```/boot/efi```, 3) recofigure and recompile the kernel in ```/opt/linux-6.1.11``` with customized drivers/microcodes and 4) reconfigure the scripts in ```/etc/init.d```, ```/etc/udev``` and ```/etc/sysconfig``` to make it bootable.
